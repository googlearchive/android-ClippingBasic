Android ClippingBasic Sample
===================================

A basic app showing how to clip on a View using [ViewOutlineProvider][1] interface,
by which a View builds its outline, used for shadowing and clipping.

Introduction
------------

The [ViewOutlineProvider][1] interface offers you a method to populate the outline of a View.
You need to implement a getOutline(android.view.View, android.graphics.Outline)
method to clip a View in a specific shape.

This example clips the outline of a View as a rounded rectangle by defining a class that
 implements ViewOutlineProvider by following code:

```java
private static class ClipOutlineProvider extends ViewOutlineProvider {
    @Override
    public void getOutline(View view, Outline outline) {
        final int margin = Math.min(view.getWidth(), view.getHeight()) / 10;
        outline.setRoundRect(margin, margin, view.getWidth() - margin,
                view.getHeight() - margin, margin / 2);
    }
}
```

To clip a View by the defined outline, setting a OutlineProvider to a View
to be clipped is needed like following:

```java
final View clippedView = view.findViewById(R.id.frame);
clippedView.setOutlineProvider(mOutlineProvider);
```

You can toggle if the View is clipped by calling [setClipToOutline(boolean)][2]
like following code:

```java
clippedView.setClipToOutline(true); // Setting false disable clipping
```
